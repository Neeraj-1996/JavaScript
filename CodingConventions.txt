1. Variable name: We use camelCase for identify names

		firstName = "John";
		lastName = "Doe";

2. Space : Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas:
		let x = y + z;
		const myArray = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];

		Code Indentation : Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks:

		function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  		  return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
		}
		

Note:- not use tab for indentataion. Different editors interpret tabs differently. 

4. Statement Rules :- Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.

		const cars = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];

		const person = {
  		firstName: "John",
  		lastName: "Doe",
  		age: 50,
  		eyeColor: "blue"
		};


5.Naming Conventions

		-Variable and function names written as camelCase
		-Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)
		-Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE
	
Note. 
	Hyphens can be mistaken as subtraction attempts. Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript names.
